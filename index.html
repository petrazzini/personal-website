        <h2>
          Hands-on design approach.

        <p>
          I believe that design is meant to be acessible, from study to practice.
        </p> 
          <p>
            Since my days as a in-house product designer I stablished a hands-on design approach, where throught simple and buzzword-free moments I helped the team understand what it is and what design can do for them. Empowering people to apply design during their days made the discussions and ideation moments more interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my carrer I partnered with companies from different backgrounds using a transparent process, that proved to me that the value isn't in the name of the process, or in the buzzword we're using when talking to the client, the value is in doing, teaching and making the client learn what is that you're doing for their product work or sell better.
