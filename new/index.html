        <p>
          I believe that design is meant to be acessible, from study to practice.</p> 
          <p>Since my days as a in-house product designer i stablished a hands-on design approach, where throught simple and buzzword-free moments i helped the team understand what it is and what design can do for them.
        </p>
        <p>Not following the current trend on design terminology helped me understand what design really is, and what we can do with it.
        </p> 
        <p>Stick to the fundamentals, understand the basics and you can apply it anywhere, anytime.</p>
