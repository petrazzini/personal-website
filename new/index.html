                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in <a href="#">Maçambará</a>, a city  in the middle of the <a href="#">Pampas</a>, known for it’s rice industry, a <a href="#">song</a> about a horse and <a href="#">Mano Lima</a>, a icon in traditional Gaúcho Music. </p> <p>
                    I moved to <a href="#">Araranguá</a> when i was 13yo, where i started studying about art, that led me to graphic design, something i fell in love with.</p> <p>
                    Graduated in Visual communication, i started working with Interface design when i was 16yo, stablishing visual patterns and components for a <a href="#">POS system</a>.</p> <p>
                    At <a href="#">TW</a> I had the opportunity to work on all products of the company, organizing my time between designing the software and building brand assets, there i learned how to work with limitations, since our product, at the time, was run in older and slow computers at regional stores. </p> <p>
                    3 years later I joined <a href="#">Organizze</a>, one of the most influential budget manager app in Brazil, there i designed the <a href="#">new brand</a>, reviewed and redesigned the  whole mobile experience, also helping build other products from scratch. </p> <p>
                    Today i run a small design firm, called <a href="#">Stoika</a> with some of my best friends, that I’m lucky enought to call them partners.</p> <p>
                    At Stoika we’re helping big corps, like <a href="#">JBS</a>, and small emerging startups, like <a href="#">Alice</a>, shape the future of their businesses digitally.</p>

                <p>
                    Acelero is one of the first platforms where you can buy a car from home, in Brazil we have a lot of bureaucracy to buy and sell cars. Throught Acelero they want to challenge that, and make the whole process of buying a used car online easier and safer.

                    They were one of the first clients of Stoika, in 2019 we started a partnership with them to maintain their product design. I was lucky enought to be responsible for their project during almost a year.

                <p>
                    Today, they are building their own design team, and growing even faster. I’m pretty happy for being part of this moment with them.
